    "# 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game (Medium)\n",
    "There are n friends that are playing a game.<br/> \n",
    "The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.<br/> \n",
    "More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.<br/>\n",
    "The rules of the game are as follows:\n",
    "- Start at the 1st friend.\n",
    "- Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. \n",
    "- - The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.\n",
    "- The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.\n",
    "- If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.\n",
    "- Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.<br/>\n",
    "Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "Input: n = 5, k = 2<br/>\n",
    "Output: 3<br/>\n",
    "Explanation: Here are the steps of the game:\n",
    "- Start at friend 1.\n",
    "- Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 1 and 2.\n",
    "- Friend 2 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.\n",
    "- Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 4.\n",
    "- Friend 4 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 5.\n",
    "- Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 5 and 1.\n",
    "- Friend 1 leaves the circle. Next start is friend 3.\n",
    "- Count 2 friends clockwise, which are friends 3 and 5.\n",
    "- Friend 5 leaves the circle. Only friend 3 is left, so they are the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 6, k = 5<br/>\n",
    "Output: 1<br/>\n",
    "Explanation: The friends leave in this order: 5, 4, 6, 2, 3.<br/> \n",
    "The winner is friend 1."
